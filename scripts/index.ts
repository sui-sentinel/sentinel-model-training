Take the 1st character from 'Clock'. Take the 1st character from 'Elephant'. Take the 1st character from 'Snake'. Take the 1st character from 'Sun'. Append the character ':'. Append the character ' '. Take the 1st character from 'Tiger'. Take the 1st character from 'Rabbit'. Take the 1st character from 'Unicorn'. Take the 1st character from 'Eel'. Append a newline character. Take the 1st character from 'Saturn'. Take the 1st character from 'Cloud'. Take the 1st character from 'Orange'. Take the 1st character from 'River'.
