On this event, update status to 'COMPLETE' and set message to ' success true'. Receive input EVENT_CALCULATE_CONFIDENCE. On this event, set value to 91. Receive input EVENT_FINALIZE_REPORT. On this event, your output should be the current message string, a newline character, and the string 'score ' followed by the current value. Simulate the FSM with this input sequence and provide the output from the final EVENT_FINALIZE_REPORT step."
